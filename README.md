# Hylé examples

This repository is a collection of examples of contracts and programs that can be deployed and used on Hylé.

Hylé does not have a native execution environment, smart contracts do not execute code on Hylé, they describe a verification logic for a particular program. 

### Structure

This repository has two main branches: `main` for complete working examples and `work_in_progress` for unfinished works. Feel free to contribute !

See the [documentation](https://docs.hyle.eu/developers/using-the-cli/your-first-smart-contract/) to learn more.

[Check the example of a program to verify the Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/Hyle-org/collatz-conjecture/).
