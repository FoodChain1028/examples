# Hylé examples

This repository is a collection of examples of contracts and programs that can be deployed and used on Hylé.

Hylé does not have a native execution environment. Smart contracts do not execute code on Hylé; they describe a verification logic for a particular program. 

See the [documentation]([https://docs.hyle.eu/developers/using-the-cli/your-first-smart-contract/](https://docs.hyle.eu/developers/examples/)) to learn more.

> ⚠️ The examples have not been audited and are not intended for production use.
